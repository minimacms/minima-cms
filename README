This is a stable version of Minima.

Hi there.
----------

A simple opensource CMS solution written in PHP.

When we look on other CMS solutions, like Joomla, we see thousands and thousands lines of code and a lot of functions that you actually don't use at all. We want to change that and make a simple CMS.

Enjoy. :)
